"""Classify an MCP streamable-HTTP request into a gate verdict input.

The proxy is the sole approval authority for MCP: every tool invocation is a
JSON-RPC ``tools/call`` carrying the exact tool name, so the gate parses the
body (precedent: ``external_apps/matching/graphql_parsing.py``) rather than
guessing from the URL. Protocol plumbing (handshake, discovery, resources)
passes ungated; anything on a matched MCP host that is neither recognizable
plumbing nor a parseable ``tools/call`` is UNCLASSIFIABLE and the gate fails
closed — credential injection covers the whole host, so an unclassifiable
request must never be forwarded with injected credentials.
